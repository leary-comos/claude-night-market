  checks (YAML deserialization, eval/exec injection,
  os.system, subprocess shell=True, dunder traversal)
  with backtick-aware filtering
- Importance-weighted decay floors for knowledge entries

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **Context warning hook delegates instead of wrapping up** (conserve) - EMERGENCY alerts now direct Claude to invoke `Skill(conserve:clear-context)` and chain to a continuation agent rather than stopping work. Recommendations changed from "summarize remaining tasks" to "delegate via continuation."
- **Tail-based context estimation** (conserve) - `estimate_context_from_session()` reads only the last 800KB of a JSONL session file and counts actual content text. The previous file-size approach over-reported context usage on long sessions with compressed history.
- **Dash-convention project directory resolution** (conserve) - Replaced MD5-hash-based directory naming with Claude Code's actual convention (`/home/user/project` becomes `-home-user-project`). The old hash approach never matched real session directories.
- **Continuation agent chaining protocol** (conserve) - Agent instructions now state: ignore "wrap up" signals from the context warning hook; chain to another continuation agent at 80% context instead of stopping.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Content assertion levels framework** (L1/L2/L3) for testing execution markdown

  - `sanctum:test-updates/modules/generation/content-test-templates.md` - BDD scaffolding
  - `pensive:test-review/modules/content-assertion-quality.md` - review scoring dimension
- Claude Code 2.1.49-2.1.63 compatibility entries in abstract docs
- 35 content assertion tests across leyline (8), conserve (included in 143), abstract (6), sanctum (15), pensive (6)
- 14 tests for enriched update-plugins output (TestReadModuleDescription, TestPrintModuleIssuesEnriched)

### Changed

- Enrich update-plugins orphaned module output with inline descriptions
- Split update-plugins command doc from 397 to 91 lines + 3 on-demand modules
- Wire ci-integration, config-file, progress-indicators into scribe slop-detector
- Iron Law enforcement now recognizes execution markdown as code (imbue)
- Test discovery reclassifies execution markdown from Low to High/Medium priority (sanctum)
- Scribe agents updated to claude-sonnet-4-6 model ID

### Fixed

- Invalid JSON code block in hook-authoring skill (removed // comments)
- Conjure bridge truncation limit corrected (100k to 50k chars)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Cross-plugin skill consolidation** - Merged 7 redundant skills into parent skills as modules, eliminated 6 commands, and consolidated 2 hooks. Net reduction: ~7,200 lines removed across 90 files.
  - `fpf-review` → `pensive:architecture-review/fpf-methodology` module
  - `evidence-logging` → `imbue:proof-of-work/evidence-logging` module
  - `damage-control` → `leyline:error-patterns/agent-damage-control` module
  - `optimizing-large-skills` → `abstract:modular-skills/optimization-techniques` module
  - `makefile-dogfooder` → `pensive:makefile-review/plugin-dogfood-checks` module
  - `performance-optimization` → `leyline:progressive-loading/performance-budgeting` module
  - `mecw-patterns` → `conserve:context-optimization/mecw-theory` module

- **Command consolidation** - Removed 6 duplicate or overlapping commands:
  - `/estimate-tokens` merged into `/context-report`
  - `/analyze-growth` merged into `/bloat-scan`
  - `/cleanup` merged into `/unbloat`
  - `/update-readme` merged into `/update-docs`
  - `/analyze-hook` merged into `/validate-hook`
  - `/skill-logs` removed (namespace collision with memory-palace)
  - `/doc-verify` and `/slop-scan` removed (agent-only, no command wrapper needed)
  - `/feature-review` removed (merged into `imbue:scope-guard`)

- **Hook consolidation** - Merged 4 hooks into 1:
  - `web_content_processor.py` + `research_storage_prompt.py` → `web_research_handler.py` (memory-palace)
  - `skill_tracker_pre.py` + `skill_tracker_post.py` removed (duplicate of abstract's canonical tracking)

- **Cross-plugin delegation** - attune skills now delegate to spec-kit rather than duplicating:
  - `attune:project-specification` delegates to `spec-kit:spec-writing`
  - `attune:project-planning` delegates to `spec-kit:task-planning`

- **Plan-before-dispatch rule** - Added enforcement requiring `EnterPlanMode` before dispatching 4+ parallel agents. Documented in `parallel-execution.md` and enforced via hookify rule.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Rules evaluation skill** (abstract) — `rules-eval` skill and `/rules-eval` command validate Claude Code rules in `.claude/rules/` directories for YAML frontmatter, glob pattern quality, content metrics, and organization patterns
- **Daily learning aggregation hook** (abstract) — `aggregate_learnings_daily.py` UserPromptSubmit hook runs on a 24h cadence to generate LEARNINGS.md, then chains to `auto_promote_learnings.py` for severity-based GitHub Issue creation (score > 5.0) or Discussion posting (score 2.0–5.0)
- **Research storage prompt** (memory-palace) — PostToolUse hook detects WebSearch usage and prompts user to store findings via `memory-palace:knowledge-intake` skill

### Fixed

- **Mermaid rendering in mdbook** — CDN-based mermaid.js initialization so diagrams render in the published book
- **Sanctum 6-complete modularization** — split 26KB hub into slim hub + 6 sub-modules for on-demand loading
- **Shared CACHE_EXCLUDES** — extract duplicate exclude lists into `update_plugins_modules/constants.py`
- **Skill frontmatter cleanup** — improved pytest-config description and verification steps

## [1.4.4] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **GitHub Discussions as agent collective memory** — Cross-session decision retrieval and knowledge sharing via GitHub Discussions GraphQL API
  - **Discussion CRUD operations** (leyline) — `command-mapping.md` extended with create, comment, search, mark-as-answer, get, update, and list-by-category GraphQL templates; GitHub-only with graceful degradation for GitLab/Bitbucket
  - **Discussion category templates** — `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/` with 4 structured forms: decisions (announcement), deliberations (open), learnings (retrospective), knowledge (Q&A)
  - **War room discussion publishing** (attune) — `discussion-publishing` module publishes completed deliberations to a "Decisions" Discussion after user approval; checks for prior decisions to avoid duplicates
  - **Session-start discussion retrieval** (leyline) — `fetch-recent-discussions.sh` SessionStart hook queries the 5 most recent Decisions discussions via a bounded GraphQL query (3s timeout, <600 tokens)
  - **Knowledge promotion to Discussions** (memory-palace) — `discussion-promotion` module promotes evergreen corpus entries to a "Knowledge" Discussion category; supports both create and update flows
  - **Scope-guard discussion linking** (imbue) — `github-integration.md` extended with optional Step 4 that creates a companion Discussion with full scoring breakdown when deferring features

### Fixed

- **Minister playbook broken CLI commands** (minister) — Replaced non-functional `gh discussion create/comment/list` CLI calls with working GraphQL mutations in `github-program-rituals.md` and `release-train-health.md`

### Changed

- **TDD gate relaxed for markdown modules** (imbue) — `tdd_bdd_gate.py` no longer gates `.md` files in `modules/` and `commands/` directories; these are agent instruction documents tested by `abstract:skills-eval`, not pytest. `SKILL.md` files remain gated.

- **Claude Code compatibility updates 2.1.41–2.1.47** (abstract, conserve, sanctum, conjure, leyline, scribe) — Documented 7 new Claude Code releases:
  - 2.1.47: `last_assistant_message` hook field, background agent transcript fix, parallel file write resilience, plan mode compaction fix, bash permission validation, concurrent agent streaming fix, memory improvements, Edit tool unicode fix, LSP gitignore filter

- **Agent worktree isolation** (abstract, attune, conserve, pensive, sanctum, spec-kit) — Added `isolation: worktree` frontmatter to 6 agents: skill-improver, project-implementer, unbloat-remediator, code-refiner, dependency-updater, workflow-improvement-implementer. Documented worktree isolation patterns in conjure agent-teams, delegation-core, conserve subagent-coordination, and sanctum parallel-execution.

- **Agent background execution** (conserve, scribe) — Added `background: true` to 4 agents: ai-hygiene-auditor, bloat-auditor, doc-verifier, slop-hunter. Documented background agent MCP restriction (background agents cannot use MCP tools).

- **Learnings-to-Discussions pipeline** (abstract) — `aggregate-logs` command extended with Phase 6a (post learnings to Discussions) and linked to new `/promote-discussions` command (Phase 6c).

- **Configuration change audit hook** (sanctum) — `config_change_audit.py` ConfigChange hook logs all settings mutations (user, project, local, policy, skills) to stderr for security audit trail; observe-only, never blocks changes.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Self-adapting skill system** (abstract) - Closed-loop homeostatic monitoring with 6 components:
  - `homeostatic_monitor.py` PostToolUse hook reads stability gap metrics from memory-palace and queues degrading skills for improvement
  - `improvement_queue.py` module with flag/trigger logic (3+ flags auto-triggers skill-improver agent)
  - `skill_versioning.py` manages YAML frontmatter versions on skill modifications
  - `experience_library.py` stores successful execution trajectories for future skill context
  - `rollback_reviewer.py` creates human-gated GitHub issues when skill regressions are detected
  - Evaluation window tracks next 10 executions after improvement to detect regressions

### Fixed

- **Continuation agent task duplication** (conserve) - Agents spawned via `Task` tool no longer create duplicate task list entries when resuming from session state checkpoints
- **Benchmark pytest marker** (sanctum) - Registered `benchmark` marker in `pyproject.toml` to eliminate `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Mission orchestrator** (attune) - `/attune:mission` command and `mission-orchestrator` skill wrap the full brainstorm→specify→plan→execute lifecycle into a single resumable command with artifact-based state detection, phase routing, and session recovery via `leyline:damage-control`

- **Damage control** (leyline) - `damage-control` skill provides agent-level error recovery for multi-agent coordination, covering crash recovery, context overflow, and merge conflict resolution

- **Risk classification** (leyline) - `risk-classification` skill implements 4-tier inline risk routing (GREEN/YELLOW/RED/CRITICAL) with heuristic matching for low-risk tasks and war-room-checkpoint escalation for high-risk decisions

- **Agent teams coordination** (conjure) - New `crew-roles` module defines agent role taxonomy and `health-monitoring` module adds health checks for multi-agent workflows

### Fixed

- **Python 3.9 compatibility** (memory-palace) - Lowered hooks `requires-python` from `>=3.10` to `>=3.9` and updated mypy/ruff targets to match macOS system Python

Feature: Consolidate skill descriptions into Claude Code official format

I want to consolidate triggers, use_when, and do_not_use_when into a single description
So that Claude Code can read all discovery info from the description field

Format: "[What it does]. Use when [scenarios]. Do not use when [anti-patterns]."

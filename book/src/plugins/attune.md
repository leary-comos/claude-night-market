# Attune

Full-cycle project development from ideation to implementation.

## Overview

Attune integrates the brainstorm-plan-execute workflow from superpowers with spec-driven development from spec-kit to provide a complete project lifecycle.

## Commands

| Command | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/attune:brainstorm` | 1. Ideation | Socratic questioning to explore problem space |
| `/attune:war-room` | 2. Deliberation | Multi-LLM expert deliberation with reversibility-based routing |
| `/attune:specify` | 3. Specification | Create detailed specs from war-room decision |
| `/attune:blueprint` | 4. Planning | Design architecture and break down tasks |
| `/attune:init` | 5. Initialization | Generate or update project structure with tooling |
| `/attune:execute` | 6. Implementation | Execute tasks with TDD discipline |
| `/attune:upgrade-project` | Maintenance | Add configs to existing projects |
| `/attune:mission` | Full Cycle | Run entire lifecycle as a single mission with state detection |
| `/attune:validate` | Quality | Validate project structure |

## Supported Languages

- **Python**: uv, pytest, ruff, mypy, pre-commit
- **Rust**: cargo, clippy, rustfmt, CI workflows
- **TypeScript/React**: npm/pnpm/yarn, vite, jest, eslint, prettier

## What Gets Configured

- Git initialization with detailed .gitignore
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows (test, lint, typecheck, publish)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, security)
- ✅ Makefile with standard development targets
- ✅ Dependency management (uv/cargo/package managers)
- ✅ Project structure (src/, tests/, README.md)

## Quick Start

### New Python Project

```bash
# Interactive mode
/attune:init

# Non-interactive
/attune:init --lang python --name my-project --author "Your Name"
```

### Full Cycle Workflow

```bash
# 1. Brainstorm the idea
/attune:brainstorm

# 2. War room deliberation (auto-routes by complexity)
/attune:war-room --from-brainstorm

# 3. Create specification
/attune:specify

# 4. Plan architecture
/attune:blueprint

# 5. Initialize project
/attune:init

# 6. Execute implementation
/attune:execute
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `project-brainstorming` | Socratic ideation workflow |
| `war-room` | Multi-LLM expert council with Type 1/2 decision routing |
| `war-room-checkpoint` | Inline RS assessment for embedded escalation during workflow |
| `project-specification` | Spec creation from war-room decision |
| `project-planning` | Architecture and task breakdown |
| `project-init` | Interactive project initialization |
| `project-execution` | Systematic implementation |
| `makefile-generation` | Generate language-specific Makefiles |
| `mission-orchestrator` | Unified brainstorm-specify-plan-execute lifecycle orchestrator |
| `workflow-setup` | Configure CI/CD pipelines |
| `precommit-setup` | Set up code quality hooks |

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `project-architect` | Guides full-cycle workflow (brainstorm → plan) |
| `project-implementer` | Executes implementation with TDD |

## Integration

Attune combines capabilities from:
- **superpowers**: Brainstorming, planning, execution workflows
- **spec-kit**: Specification-driven development
- **abstract**: Plugin and skill authoring for plugin projects

## War Room Integration

The war room is a mandatory phase after brainstorming. It automatically routes to the appropriate deliberation intensity based on Reversibility Score (RS):

| Mode | RS Range | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Express | ≤ 0.40 | <2 min | Quick decision by Chief Strategist |
| Lightweight | 0.41-0.60 | 5-10 min | 3-expert panel |
| Full Council | 0.61-0.80 | 15-30 min | 7-expert deliberation |
| Delphi | > 0.80 | 30-60 min | Iterative consensus for critical decisions |

The `war-room-checkpoint` skill can also trigger additional deliberation during planning or execution when high-stakes decisions arise.

### Discussion Publishing

After the Supreme Commander synthesis (Phase 7), the war room offers to publish the decision to a GitHub Discussion in the "Decisions" category. This requires user approval and checks for prior decisions on the same topic to avoid duplicates. The published Discussion includes the full decision record with alternatives considered, scoring breakdown, and implementation guidance. Local strategeion files remain the primary record; the Discussion is an additional cross-session discovery channel.

## Examples

### Initialize Python CLI Project

```bash
/attune:init --lang python --type cli
```

Creates:
- `pyproject.toml` with uv configuration
- `Makefile` with test/lint/format targets
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Pre-commit hooks for ruff and mypy
- Basic CLI structure

### Upgrade Existing Project

```bash
# Add missing configs
/attune:upgrade-project

# Validate structure
/attune:validate
```

## Configuration

### Custom Templates

Place custom templates in:
- `~/.claude/attune/templates/` (user-level)
- `.attune/templates/` (project-level)
- `$ATTUNE_TEMPLATES_PATH` (environment variable)

### Reference Projects

Templates sync from reference projects:
- `simple-resume` (Python)
- `skrills` (multi-language)
- `importobot` (automation)

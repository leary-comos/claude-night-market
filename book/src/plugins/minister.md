## Scripts

| Script | Description |

## Usage Examples

### Initiative Tracking

## Initiative Structure

Initiatives track work across issues and PRs:

```yaml

  id: auth-v2
  title: "Authentication v2"
  status: in-progress
  milestones:
    - name: "OAuth Setup"

  metrics:
    velocity: 3.5 issues/week

```

## Health Gates

Release health gates verify readiness:

| **CI** | All checks passing, no flaky tests |
| **Docs** | README updated, CHANGELOG complete |

```

## Superpowers Integration

| Skill | Enhancement |
|-------|-------------|
| `issue-management` | Uses `systematic-debugging` for investigation |

## Configuration

### tracker.yaml

```yaml
github:
  repo: athola/my-project
  token_env: GITHUB_TOKEN

initiatives_dir: .minister/initiatives
reports_dir: .minister/reports

health_gates:
  coverage_threshold: 80
  max_critical_vulns: 0
  require_changelog: true
```

## Workflow Examples

### Sprint Planning

```bash
# Check initiative status
python tracker.py list

# Update priorities
python tracker.py update auth-v2 --priority high

# Generate planning report
python tracker.py report --planning
```

### Release Preparation

```bash
# Run health gates
Skill(minister:release-health-gates)

# Address any failures
# Then re-run until all pass

# Tag release
git tag v2.0.0
```

### Weekly Standup

```bash
# Generate pulse report
Skill(minister:github-initiative-pulse)

```

## Playbooks

Minister includes operational playbooks in `docs/playbooks/`:

| Playbook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `github-program-rituals.md` | Weekly cadences: Risk Radar, Velocity Digest, Executive Packet |
| `release-train-health.md` | Release gate checklists for CI, docs, and support signals |

These playbooks use GitHub Discussions via GraphQL mutations (not the non-existent `gh discussion` CLI subcommand). Discussion creation and commenting follow the templates in `leyline:git-platform`'s `command-mapping` module.

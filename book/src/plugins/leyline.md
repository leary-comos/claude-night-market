# leyline

Infrastructure and pipeline building blocks for plugins.

## Overview

Leyline provides reusable infrastructure patterns that other plugins build on. Think of it as a standard library for plugin development - error handling, authentication, storage, and testing patterns.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install leyline@claude-night-market
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| `/update-all-plugins` | Update all installed plugins from marketplaces |
| `/verify-plugin` | Verify plugin trust via ERC-8004 Reputation Registry |

## Usage Examples

### Plugin Management

```bash
# Refresh all plugins (fixes version mismatches)
/reinstall-all-plugins

# Update to latest versions
/update-all-plugins
```

### Using as Dependencies

Leyline skills are typically used as dependencies in other plugins:

```yaml
# In your skill's SKILL.md frontmatter
dependencies:
  - leyline:error-patterns
  - leyline:quota-management
```

### Error Handling Pattern

```bash
Skill(leyline:error-patterns)

# Provides:
# - Structured error types
# - Recovery strategies
# - Logging standards
# - User-friendly messages
```

### Authentication Pattern

```bash
Skill(leyline:authentication-patterns)

# Covers:
# - API key management
# - OAuth flows
# - Token refresh
# - Secret storage
```

### Testing Standards

```bash
Skill(leyline:testing-quality-standards)

# Enforces:
# - Test naming conventions
# - Coverage requirements
# - Mocking guidelines
# - Fixture patterns
```

## Pattern Categories

### Rate Limiting

```python
# quota-management pattern
from leyline import QuotaManager

manager = QuotaManager(
    daily_limit=1000,
    hourly_limit=100,
    burst_limit=10
)

if manager.can_proceed():
    # Make API call
    manager.record_usage()
```

### Telemetry

```python
# usage-logging pattern
from leyline import UsageLogger

logger = UsageLogger(output="telemetry.csv")
logger.log_tool_use("WebFetch", tokens=500, latency_ms=1200)
```

### Storage Abstraction

```python
# storage-templates pattern
from leyline import Storage

storage = Storage.from_config()
storage.save("key", data)
data = storage.load("key")
```

## Discussion Operations (GitHub Only)

The `git-platform` skill's `command-mapping` module provides GraphQL templates for GitHub Discussions. These templates are consumed by attune (war room publishing), imbue (scope-guard linking), memory-palace (knowledge promotion), and minister (playbook rituals).

Supported operations: create, comment, threaded reply, mark-as-answer, search, get-by-number, update, and list-by-category. Category resolution from slug to `nodeId` is included as a prerequisite step.

On non-GitHub platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket), all Discussion operations are skipped with a warning.

A `fetch-recent-discussions.sh` SessionStart hook queries the 5 most recent "Decisions" discussions at session start and injects a summary (<600 tokens) so that new sessions can discover prior deliberations.

An `auto-star-repo.sh` SessionStart hook stars the repository if not already starred. The hook is idempotent (checks status before acting), never unstars, and fails silently if no auth method is available.

## Integration

Leyline is used by:

- **abstract**: Plugin validation uses error patterns
- **conjure**: Delegation uses quota management
- **conservation**: Context optimization uses MECW patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Don't Duplicate**: Use leyline patterns instead of reimplementing
2. **Compose Patterns**: Combine multiple patterns for complex needs
3. **Test with Standards**: Use pytest-config for consistent testing
4. **Log Everything**: Use usage-logging for debugging and analytics

## Related Plugins

- **abstract**: Uses leyline for plugin infrastructure
- **conjure**: Uses leyline for quota and service management
- **conservation**: Uses leyline for MECW implementation

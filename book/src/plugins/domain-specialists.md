# Domain Specialists

Domain specialist plugins provide deep expertise in specific areas of software development.

## Purpose

Domain plugins offer:

- **Deep Expertise**: Specialized knowledge for specific domains
- **Workflow Automation**: End-to-end processes for common tasks
- **Best Practices**: Curated patterns and anti-patterns

## Plugins

| [archetypes](archetypes.md) | Architecture | Paradigm selection |
| [pensive](pensive.md) | Code Review | Multi-faceted reviews |
| [parseltongue](parseltongue.md) | Python | Modern Python development |
| [memory-palace](memory-palace.md) | Knowledge | Spatial memory organization |
| [spec-kit](spec-kit.md) | Specifications | Spec-driven development |
| [minister](minister.md) | Releases | Initiative tracking |
| [attune](attune.md) | Projects | Full-cycle project development |
| [scry](scry.md) | Media | Documentation recordings |
| [scribe](scribe.md) | Documentation | AI slop detection and cleanup |

## Dependencies

Most domain plugins depend on foundation layers:

```
archetypes (standalone)
pensive --> imbue, sanctum
parseltongue (standalone)
memory-palace (standalone)
spec-kit --> imbue
minister (standalone)
attune --> spec-kit, imbue
scry (standalone)
scribe --> imbue, conserve
```

## Example Workflows

### Architecture Decision
```bash
Skill(archetypes:architecture-paradigms)
# Interactive paradigm selection
# Returns: Detailed implementation guide
```

### Full Code Review
```bash
/full-review
# Runs multiple review types:
# - architecture-review
# - api-review
# - bug-review
# - test-review
```

### Python Project Setup
```bash
Skill(parseltongue:python-packaging)
Skill(parseltongue:python-testing)
```

### Feature Development
```bash
/speckit-specify Add user authentication
/speckit-plan
/speckit-tasks
/speckit-implement
```

### Full Project Lifecycle
```bash
/attune:brainstorm
# Socratic questioning to explore project idea

/attune:specify
# Create specification from brainstorm

/attune:blueprint
# Design architecture and break down tasks

/attune:init
# Initialize project with tooling

/attune:execute
# Execute implementation with TDD
```

### Media Recording
```bash
/record-terminal
# Creates VHS tape script and records terminal to GIF

/record-browser
# Records browser session with Playwright
```

### Documentation Cleanup
```bash
Skill(scribe:slop-detector)
# Scans for AI-generated content markers

/doc-polish README.md
# Interactive cleanup of AI slop

Agent(scribe:doc-verifier)
# Validates documentation claims
```

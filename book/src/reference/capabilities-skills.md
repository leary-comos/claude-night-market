# Skill Reference

Skills are methodology guides loaded via `Skill(plugin:skill-name)`. They inject structured workflows, checklists, and decision frameworks into the conversation. Unlike commands, skills don't run a process; they teach Claude Code *how* to approach a problem.

## Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Basic invocation
Skill(plugin:skill-name)

# With context
Skill(imbue:scope-guard) # When evaluating new features
Skill(imbue:proof-of-work) # Before claiming completion

# Chained invocation
Skill(superpowers:brainstorming)
# ... then later ...
Skill(imbue:scope-guard) # Evaluate brainstorm results
```

**Skill Components**: Every skill starts with YAML frontmatter (name, description, tags, dependencies, token estimate). Larger skills split content into a `modules/` directory. Many skills define TodoWrite items as checkpoints and exit criteria that mark the skill complete. As of Claude Code 2.1.20+, completed tasks can be deleted via TaskUpdate to reduce clutter — though proof-of-work and audit items should be preserved.

**Skill Description Budget (2.1.32+)**: Skill character budgets now scale at 2% of context window instead of a fixed limit. On 200K context this yields ~4K chars; on 1M context ~20K chars. Skills from `--add-dir` directories are also auto-discovered (2.1.32+). Skills without additional permissions or hooks are auto-approved without user confirmation (2.1.19+).

## Abstract Plugin

### `abstract:skill-authoring`
TDD methodology for creating new skills.

**Invocation**: `Skill(abstract:skill-authoring)`

**TodoWrite Items**:
- `skill-authoring:test-scenario-defined`
- `skill-authoring:acceptance-criteria-written`
- `skill-authoring:skill-implemented`
- `skill-authoring:validation-passed`

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# When creating a new skill
Skill(abstract:skill-authoring)
# Follow TDD: write test scenario first
# Define acceptance criteria
# Implement skill to pass tests
# Validate with /abstract:test-skill
```

### `abstract:hook-authoring`
Security-first hook development patterns.

**Invocation**: `Skill(abstract:hook-authoring)`

## Imbue Plugin

### `imbue:scope-guard`
Anti-overengineering and scope control.

**Invocation**: `Skill(imbue:scope-guard)`

**Worthiness Formula**:
```

- `> 2.0` - Implement now
- `1.0 - 2.0` - Discuss first
- `< 1.0` - Defer to backlog

**TodoWrite Items**:
- `scope-guard:worthiness-scored`
- `scope-guard:backlog-compared`
- `scope-guard:budget-checked`
- `scope-guard:github-issue-created` (if deferring)
- `scope-guard:decision-documented`

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
# During brainstorming
Skill(imbue:scope-guard)
# Score proposed feature: (3 + 2 + 1) / (5 + 2 + 3) = 0.6
# Score < 1.0 -> Defer to backlog
# Create GitHub issue, add to backlog queue
```

### `imbue:proof-of-work`
Evidence-based completion validation.

**Invocation**: `Skill(imbue:proof-of-work)`

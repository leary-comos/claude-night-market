# Agent Reference

Agents are specialized subagents that Claude Code can dispatch for focused work. Each agent has a fixed toolset, runs on a specific model tier (haiku/sonnet/opus), and knows when to escalate to a more capable model. The parent session decides whether the task justifies the overhead of spinning up an agent; simple tasks should be handled directly.

## Agent Configuration

**Frontmatter Options**:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: |
  Agent description with triggers and use-cases.
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]  # Available tools
  # Task(agent-name) restricts sub-agent spawning (2.1.33+)
model: haiku|sonnet|opus                        # Base model
permissionMode: acceptEdits                     # Permission automation
background: true                                # Always run in background (2.1.20+)
isolation: worktree                             # Git worktree isolation (2.1.33+)
memory: user|project|local                      # Persistent memory scope (2.1.33+)
skills: plugin:skill1, plugin:skill2            # Auto-loaded skills
escalation:
  to: opus                                      # Escalation target
  hints:
    - security_audit                            # Trigger conditions
    - complex_architecture
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      command: "echo 'logged'"
---
```

**Background Mode (2.1.20+)**: When `background: true` is set, the
agent runs in the background without blocking the parent session.
Permission prompts are collected before the agent launches.

**Worktree Isolation (2.1.33+)**: When `isolation: worktree` is set,
the agent runs in a dedicated git worktree, preventing file conflicts
with the parent session or other agents.

**Permission Modes**:
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Prompt for permissions |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits |
| `plan` | Planning only, no execution |

**Background Agent Permissions (2.1.20+)**: Background agents now prompt for tool permissions *before* launching into the background. This prevents agents from stalling mid-execution waiting for approval. Multi-agent dispatches may show sequential permission prompts before work begins.

**Task Deletion (2.1.20+)**: Agents with `TodoWrite` in their tools list can now delete completed tasks via `TaskUpdate`. Use deletion to clean up transient tracking items after workflow completion.

**Agent Memory (2.1.33+)**: Agents can declare persistent memory scope via `memory` frontmatter:
| Scope | Persistence |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Across all projects for the user |
| `project` | Within a specific project |
| `local` | Current session only |

**Sub-Agent Restrictions (2.1.33+)**: Use `Task(agent-name)` in the `tools` list to restrict which sub-agents an agent can spawn. For example, `tools: [Read, Task(code-reviewer)]` only allows dispatching `code-reviewer`. Omitting Task restrictions allows spawning any agent.

**Agent Team Hooks (2.1.33+)**: Two new hook events for multi-agent coordination:
- `TeammateIdle` — triggered when a teammate agent becomes idle
- `TaskCompleted` — triggered when a task finishes execution

**Model Selection**:
| Model | Use Case | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| `haiku` | Simple, repetitive tasks | Lowest |
| `sonnet` | Standard complexity | Medium |
| `opus` | Complex reasoning | Highest |

```

### `conserve:unbloat-remediator`

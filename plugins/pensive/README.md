## Quick Start

### Unified Review

Run `/full-review` to automatically detect and execute relevant checks. Focus on specific areas by appending the domain, such as `/full-review api` or `/full-review bugs`. Use `/full-review all` to execute all applicable domain reviews.

### Domain-Specific Reviews

Trigger specialized reviews directly for focused audits: `/rust-review`, `/api-review`, `/test-review`, or `/fpf-review` for architectural analysis.

### Skill Performance Review

Use `/skill-review` to view health metrics across all skills. Append `--unstable-only` to identify skills with a stability gap greater than 0.3. Use `/skill-history` to view executions from the last hour or filter by failures using `--failures-only`.

## Skill Selection Logic

Unified reviews select skills based on codebase patterns. Rust files (`*.rs`, `Cargo.toml`) trigger `rust-review`, `bug-review`, and `api-review`. API definitions (`openapi.yaml`) trigger `api-review` and `architecture-review`. Test files trigger `test-review`, and build scripts trigger `makefile-review` or `shell-review`.

## Output Standards

Reviews produce structured output including an overall assessment, high/medium/low severity findings with file and line references, actionable tasks with owners and dates, and a final recommendation to approve, block, or approve with actions.

## Review Workflow

Reviews identify modified files and apply domain-specific checks. Findings are documented with precise location data, severity rankings, and specific remediation steps.

## Progress Tracking

Skills use `TodoWrite` for lifecycle tracking, moving from surface inventory and exemplar research to consistency audits and evidence logging.

## Session Forking (Claude Code 2.0.73+)

Fork sessions for parallel specialized reviews. For example, use `claude --fork-session --session-id "security-audit"` to isolate a security audit while maintaining the main review context. Extract findings before closing the fork and synthesize them into the final report.

## Skill Performance Monitoring

Pensive tracks skill execution to identify brittle tools by calculating the stability gap (the difference between average and worst-case accuracy). A gap below 0.2 indicates stable performance, while a gap above 0.3 requires investigation. Data is stored in `~/.claude/skills/logs/` in JSONL format, with history aggregated in `.history.json`.

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- Domain-specific review skills are an opportunity to
  add example findings so users know what good output
  looks like before running their first review
- The unified review selection logic could document its
  file-pattern matching rules in a reference table
- Output standards (severity levels, remediation steps)
  would benefit from a sample report for each domain
- Stability gap thresholds (0.2 stable, 0.3 investigate)
  could include guidance on how to recalibrate them

stewardship principles guiding this project.

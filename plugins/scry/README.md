# Scry

Media generation for terminal recordings, browser automation, GIF processing, and tutorial composition.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Record a terminal session
/record-terminal --output demo.gif

# Record a browser session
/record-browser --url https://example.com

# Use VHS tape scripts for terminal recordings
Skill(scry:vhs-recording)

# Combine media assets into tutorials
Skill(scry:media-composition)
```

## Overview

Scry manages terminal and browser recordings to create technical demos and tutorials. It uses VHS (Charmbracelet) for terminal tape scripts and Playwright for browser automation, allowing for both interactive and programmatic recording workflows. The plugin also handles GIF optimization and media composition to combine disparate assets into cohesive documentation.

## Features

### Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **vhs-recording** | Terminal recordings using VHS (Charmbracelet) with tape scripts. |
| **browser-recording** | Browser automation recordings using Playwright. |
| **gif-generation** | GIF processing and optimization. |
| **media-composition** | Combine media assets into tutorials and demos. |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/record-terminal` | Create terminal recordings with VHS tape scripts. |
| `/record-browser` | Record browser sessions using Playwright. |

## Quick Start and Workflow Patterns

To create a tutorial, use `vhs-recording` for terminal demonstrations and `browser-recording` for web interface walkthroughs. These assets can then be merged using the `media-composition` skill. For standalone demos, record terminal sessions directly with `/record-terminal` and optimize the final output through `gif-generation`.

Playwright is recommended for automated recording and CI/CD environments, while Claude Code's native Chrome integration is often better for interactive debugging. When generating media, Claude Code 2.0.73+ supports clickable image links that allow for immediate verification of recording quality within the default viewer.

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- VHS tape script examples are an opportunity to include
  annotated templates showing common recording patterns
- The media composition skill could document resolution
  and frame rate recommendations for different outputs
- GIF optimization settings would benefit from a table
  showing file size vs. quality trade-offs at each level
- Browser recording could include a quick checklist of
  prerequisites (Playwright version, browser binaries)

## Review Classification Framework

### Blocking Issues
Must fix before merge:
- **Version mismatches** (marketplace vs actual, CHANGELOG missing, etc.)
- Bugs introduced by this change
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes without migration
- Missing core requirements
- Test failures in new code

### In-Scope Issues
Should address in this PR:
- Incomplete requirement implementation
- Missing error handling specified in requirements
- Performance issues affecting feature
- Edge cases not covered

### Suggestions (Author's Discretion)
Nice improvements:
- Better variable names
- Minor optimizations
- Additional test cases
- Documentation improvements

### Backlog Items
Create GitHub issues (primary storage):
- Refactoring opportunities
- "While we're here" improvements
- Feature expansions
- Technical debt in adjacent code

**Important**: GitHub issues are the source of truth for backlog items. Reference existing `docs/backlog/*.md` files for context (e.g., `docs/backlog/queue.md`, `docs/backlog/technical-debt.md`) to avoid duplicates.

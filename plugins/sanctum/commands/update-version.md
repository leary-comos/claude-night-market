# Bump Project Versions

Before changing any version numbers, load the required skills in order:

1. Run `Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)` to capture repository status and diffs, completing its `TodoWrite` items.
2. Run `Skill(sanctum:version-updates)` and follow its checklist (context, targets, edits, docs, verification).

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Update Config Files
- Determine the desired version (the default bump is a patch). If the user passed an explicit version, record it before editing files.
- **Option 1 (Automated)**: Use `plugins/sanctum/scripts/update_versions.py <version> --dry-run` to preview, then run without `--dry-run` to apply
  - Automatically finds and updates all version files including nested ones (e.g., `plugins/memory-palace/hooks/pyproject.toml`)
  - Supports pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, package.json, plugin.json, metadata.json
  - Supports SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter containing `version:` field
  - Excludes virtual environments and build directories
- **Option 2 (Manual)**: Update all relevant configuration files manually

### Phase 2: Update Documentation Files
Version numbers appear in documentation that the automated script does NOT update:

| File | What to Update |
|------|----------------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add new version section with date and changes |
| `docs/api-overview.md` | Plugin inventory table, individual plugin version headers |
| `book/src/reference/capabilities-reference.md` | Version-specific feature annotations |
| Plugin `README.md` files | Version references in examples |

**Scan for stale versions:**
```bash
# Find docs referencing the OLD version (replace X.Y.Z)
grep -r "X\.Y\.Z" docs/ book/ plugins/*/README.md --include="*.md"
```

### Phase 3: Verification
- Run any required tests or builds, then show the resulting `git diff` to confirm the changes.
- Verify no stale version references remain in documentation.

## Manual Execution
If a skill cannot be loaded, follow these steps:
- Manually gather `git status -sb` and the list of files containing version strings.
- Apply the version bump, update documentation, and verify with tests and diffs before summarizing the outcome.

## Post-Implementation Checklist Reminder

If you just completed a feature implementation or plan execution,
verify these were done:

### PROOF-OF-WORK (Verify First!)
- [ ] Invoked `Skill(imbue:proof-of-work)`
- [ ] Created TodoWrite items: `proof:solution-tested`, `proof:evidence-captured`
- [ ] Captured evidence with `[E1]`, `[E2]` references
- [ ] Ran functional tests (not just syntax validation)
- [ ] Reported status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] `/sanctum:update-docs`
- [ ] `/abstract:make-dogfood`
- [ ] `/sanctum:update-readme`
- [ ] `/sanctum:update-tests`

### Stewardship
- [ ] Left the campsite better? (See `Skill(leyline:stewardship)`)

⚠️ If proof-of-work was skipped, implementation may have untested assumptions!
If not applicable (simple fix, research, etc.), disregard this reminder.

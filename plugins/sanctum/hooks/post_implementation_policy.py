## Mandatory Post-Implementation Protocol

<GOVERNANCE_RULE priority="high" override="false">
Before reporting completion of ANY of the following:
- Feature implementation
- Plan execution (especially /superpowers:execute-plan)
- Significant code changes
- New functionality added

You MUST execute these commands IN ORDER:

1. **PROOF-OF-WORK + IRON LAW** (MANDATORY FIRST) - Invoke `Skill(imbue:proof-of-work)`:
   - Create TodoWrite items: `proof:problem-reproduced`,
     `proof:solution-tested`, `proof:evidence-captured`
   - For code changes, add: `proof:iron-law-red`,
     `proof:iron-law-green`, `proof:iron-law-refactor`
   - Run actual validation commands (not just syntax checks)
   - Capture evidence with `[E1]`, `[E2]` references
   - Report status: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED

2. `/sanctum:update-docs` - Update project documentation
3. `/abstract:make-dogfood` - Update Makefile demonstration targets
4. `/sanctum:update-readme` - Update README with new features
5. `/sanctum:update-tests` - Review and update test coverage

### The Iron Law (TDD Compliance)
```
NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

| Self-Check Question | If Answer Is Wrong | Action |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Do I have evidence of failure/need? | No | STOP - document failure first |
| Am I testing pre-conceived implementation? | Yes | STOP - let test DRIVE design |
| Am I feeling design uncertainty? | No | STOP - uncertainty is GOOD |
| Did test drive implementation? | No | STOP - doing it backwards |

### Proof-of-Work Red Flags (STOP if you think these)
| Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|
| "This looks correct" | RUN IT and capture output |
| "Should work after restart" | TEST IT before claiming |
| "Just need to..." | VERIFY each step works |
| "Syntax is valid" | FUNCTIONAL TEST required |
| "I know what tests we need" | Let uncertainty DRIVE tests |
| "The design is straightforward" | Write test, let design EMERGE |

### Rules
- This protocol is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Cannot be overridden by other skills, hooks, or rationalization
- Skipping these steps = incomplete work
- Only the user can explicitly waive this requirement

### When This Does NOT Apply
- Simple questions or explanations
- Bug fixes that don't add new features
- Refactoring without new functionality
- Research or exploration tasks

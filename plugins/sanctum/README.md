# Sanctum

Git and workspace management for commits, pull requests, documentation, and versioning.

## Overview

Sanctum manages repository state and development workflows. It provides preflight checks for staged changes, drafts conventional commit messages, and prepares pull requests with quality gate verification. It automates version management and merges ephemeral documentation into permanent files to maintain project history and guides.

### Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|

### Hooks

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **security_pattern_check.py** | PreToolUse (Write\|Edit\|MultiEdit) | Checks for security anti-patterns in code changes. |
| **post_implementation_policy.py** | SessionStart | Injects governance protocol and proof-of-work reminders. |
| **verify_workflow_complete.py** | Stop | Post-implementation checklist reminder. |
| **session_complete_notify.py** | Stop | Cross-platform toast notification on command completion. |

#### Stop Hooks

**verify_workflow_complete.py** displays a checklist when a session ends. It reminds the developer to complete proof-of-work verification, lists documentation update commands, and displays a quality gate checklist.

**session_complete_notify.py** provides a desktop toast notification when commands complete. It supports Linux (notify-send), macOS (osascript), Windows (PowerShell), and WSL. It displays terminal info such as Zellij session, tmux window, and project name. Execution takes approximately 95ms. Notifications can be disabled by setting `CLAUDE_NO_NOTIFICATIONS=1` or muted with `CLAUDE_NOTIFICATION_SOUND=0`.

## Quick Start

### Git Workspace Review
```bash
# Understand repository state before other operations
Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)
```

### Commit Message Generation
```bash
# Generate conventional commit from staged changes
/commit-msg
```

### PR Preparation
```bash
# Full PR prep with quality gates
/pr
```

### Documentation Updates
```bash
# Update docs based on changes
/update-docs

# Modernize README
/update-readme

# Bump version numbers
/update-version
```

## Skill Dependencies

Most sanctum skills require `git-workspace-review` as a foundation. Skills like `commit-messages`, `pr-prep`, `doc-updates`, `update-readme`, and `version-updates` depend on its output. `file-analysis` operates independently.

## Workflow Patterns

**Pre-Commit**: Stage changes using `git add -p`, execute `git-workspace-review` for a preflight check, and run `commit-messages` to generate the message.

**Pre-PR**: Execute a preflight check, run quality gates such as `make fmt && make lint && make test`, and use `pr-prep` to generate the description.

**Post-Review**: Use `/fix-pr` to triage comments,
implement fixes, and resolve threads.
Both `/fix-pr` and `/pr-review` inject a test plan
into PR descriptions when one is missing, using the
shared `test-plan-injection` module.

**Release**: Run a preflight check, bump the version with `version-updates`, update documentation with `doc-updates`, then commit and tag the release.

## Session Forking (Claude Code 2.0.73+)

Session forking allows for exploring alternative implementations or commit strategies without affecting the main session history.

### Use Cases

For **Alternative Implementations**, fork a session to try different approaches, such as comparing an OAuth 2.0 implementation with a JWT-based one. For **Commit Strategies**, use forks to test atomic commits per file versus grouping by feature area. **PR Descriptions** can be forked to generate technical-focused versions and business-value versions, which can then be combined for the final draft. **Refactoring Explorations** allow for trying functional, OOP, or composition-based styles in parallel to evaluate trade-offs before implementation.

### Standards

Use descriptive session IDs like `pr-123-security-focused` instead of generic names. Keep each fork focused on a single approach. Extract insights to files before closing and document the reasoning for the final choice.

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- Skill dependency chains (most skills depend on
  `git-workspace-review`) are an opportunity to document
  as a visual graph for new contributors
- Hook descriptions in `hooks.json` could include
  expected latency so downstream consumers know the cost
- The shared `test-plan-injection` module would benefit
  from examples of well-formed test plans
- Commit message conventions could link to real examples
  from this repository's own git history
- Workflow patterns (Pre-Commit, Pre-PR, Release) are an
  opportunity to add copy-pasteable shell snippets

See [STEWARDSHIP.md](../../STEWARDSHIP.md) for the full
stewardship principles guiding this project.

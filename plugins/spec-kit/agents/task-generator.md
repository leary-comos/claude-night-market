description: Generate dependency-ordered implementation tasks from specification and
  planning artifacts. Use when generating tasks from spec and plan, breaking down
  implementation work, creating ordered task lists, starting implementation phase.
  Do not use when analyzing specifications - use spec-analyzer agent. executing tasks
  - use implementation-executor agent. Trigger proactively during /speckit-tasks commands.

examples:
- context: User has a completed spec and plan
  user: Generate tasks from my feature spec
  assistant: I'll use the task-generator agent to create an ordered task list.
- context: User wants to break down implementation work
  user: Create implementation tasks for this feature
  assistant: Let me generate dependency-ordered tasks from your artifacts.
- context: User is starting implementation phase
  user: What tasks do I need to implement this feature?
  assistant: I'll analyze your spec and plan to generate actionable tasks.

# Task Generator Agent

Generates dependency-ordered implementation tasks from specification and planning artifacts.

## Capabilities

- Parse spec.md requirements and user scenarios
- Extract technical decisions from plan.md
- Generate phased, dependency-ordered tasks
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Map tasks to files and components
- Estimate task complexity

## Task Phases

### Phase 0: Setup
- Project initialization
- Dependency installation
- Configuration files

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Data models and types
- Core interfaces and contracts
- Test infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Business logic
- API endpoints
- Database operations

### Phase 3: Integration
- External service connections
- Middleware and hooks
- Error handling

### Phase 4: Polish
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Final testing

## Task Format

Each task includes:
- Unique ID (TASK-001, TASK-002, etc.)
- Description
- Phase assignment
- Dependencies (sequential vs parallel [P])
- File paths affected
- Acceptance criteria

## Output

Generates `tasks.md` with:
- Ordered task list by phase
- Dependency graph
- Parallel execution markers
- Estimated complexity

## Usage

Provide paths to spec and plan:
```
Generate tasks from .specify/specs/feature-name/
```

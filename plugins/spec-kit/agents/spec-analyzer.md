description: Analyze specification artifacts for consistency, coverage, and quality
  issues. Use when checking spec quality, validating spec/plan/tasks alignment, debugging
  missing requirements, detecting ambiguity or underspecification. Do not use when
  writing specifications - use spec-writing skill. generating tasks - use task-generator
  agent. Trigger proactively during /speckit-analyze commands.

examples:
- context: User wants to check spec quality
  user: Analyze my feature specification
  assistant: I'll use the spec-analyzer agent to check for consistency, coverage,
    and quality issues.
- context: User has completed tasks.md and wants verification
  user: Are my spec, plan, and tasks aligned?
  assistant: Let me analyze the cross-artifact consistency for you.
- context: User is debugging missing requirements
  user: What requirements don't have tasks?
  assistant: I'll analyze the coverage gaps between your spec and tasks.

# Spec Analyzer Agent

Analyzes specification artifacts for consistency, coverage, and quality issues.

## Capabilities

- Cross-artifact consistency checking (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- Requirement coverage analysis
- Ambiguity and underspecification detection
- Constitution alignment validation
- Terminology drift identification
- Duplicate requirement detection

## Analysis Categories

### Consistency Checks
- Terminology consistency across artifacts
- Data entity alignment between spec and plan
- Task ordering matches dependency requirements

### Coverage Analysis
- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks without mapped requirements
- Non-functional requirements coverage

### Quality Metrics
- Ambiguity detection (vague terms without measurable criteria)
- Duplicate/near-duplicate requirements
- Unresolved placeholders (TODO, ???, TKTK)

## Severity Classification

- **CRITICAL**: Constitution violations, missing core requirements, zero coverage
- **HIGH**: Conflicting requirements, security/performance ambiguities
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing edge cases
- **LOW**: Style improvements, minor redundancy

## Output Format

Returns structured analysis report with:
- Findings table (ID, Category, Severity, Location, Summary, Recommendation)
- Coverage summary
- Metrics (total requirements, coverage %, issue counts)
- Next actions

## Usage

Provide the feature directory path:
```
Analyze the specification at .specify/specs/feature-name/
```

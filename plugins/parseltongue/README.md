# Parseltongue

Python development skills for Claude Code, focusing on testing, performance profiling, async patterns, and packaging.

## Overview

Parseltongue implements specialized patterns for Python development. It includes structured guides for `pytest` and TDD workflows, profiling methods for identifying CPU and memory hotspots, and `asyncio` patterns for concurrent I/O. The plugin also provides templates for `pyproject.toml` configuration and `uv` dependency management.

## Features

### Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **python-testing** | Pytest patterns, fixtures, mocking, and TDD cycles. |
| **python-performance** | CPU/memory profiling and local benchmarking. |
| **python-async** | asyncio concurrency and async/await patterns. |
| **python-packaging** | pyproject.toml standards and uv integration. |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/analyze-tests` | Reports on test suite coverage and fixture usage. |
| `/run-profiler` | Runs cProfile/memory_profiler on target scripts. |
| `/check-async` | Scans for blocking calls in async functions. |

## Integration

Parseltongue works with standard Python tools:
- **Package Managers**: Native support for `uv`, `pip`, and `poetry`.
- **Quality Tools**: Integration with `ruff` for linting and `mypy` for type checking.
- **Frameworks**: Patterns for FastAPI, Django, and SQLAlchemy applications.

Testing follows a Red-Green-Refactor cycle using `pytest` fixtures. Performance optimization focuses on identifying bottlenecks via line-profiling before applying caches or algorithmic improvements. Async patterns prioritize non-blocking I/O to manage high-concurrency workloads without thread overhead.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or later (supported back to 3.9).
- `uv` recommended for dependency isolation.

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- Each skill (testing, performance, async, packaging) is
  an opportunity to add a minimal working example that
  users can copy and adapt for their own projects
- The profiling skill could document common pitfalls
  when interpreting cProfile output for async code
- Framework integration notes (FastAPI, Django) would
  benefit from version-specific guidance and caveats
- Python 3.9 compatibility boundaries deserve a note
  clarifying which features require newer versions

See [STEWARDSHIP.md](../../STEWARDSHIP.md) for the full
stewardship principles guiding this project.

# Pipeline Module

Defines the four stages of the egregore pipeline, their
steps, transition rules, and idempotency guarantees.

## Stages and Steps

The pipeline has four stages, executed in fixed order.
Each stage contains ordered steps that run sequentially.

### 1. Intake

Parse the input, validate it, and prioritize across
multiple items.

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| parse | Extract requirements from prompt text or GitHub issue |
| validate | Confirm requirements are specific enough to act on |
| prioritize | Order items by complexity (single item = skip this step) |

### 2. Build

Transform requirements into working code through the
attune project lifecycle.

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| brainstorm | Explore approaches and constraints |
| specify | Produce a formal specification document |
| blueprint | Create an implementation plan with task breakdown |
| execute | Implement the plan, writing code and tests |

### 3. Quality

Review, refine, and verify the implementation.

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| code-review | First-pass review for correctness and style |
| unbloat | Detect and remove unnecessary code or files |
| code-refinement | Apply review feedback and polish |
| update-tests | Add or fix tests to match implementation |
| update-docs | Update documentation to reflect changes |

### 4. Ship

Prepare, review, and merge the pull request.

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| prepare-pr | Create the PR with title, body, and labels |
| pr-review | Run automated PR review checks |
| fix-pr | Apply fixes from the PR review |
| merge | Merge the PR (requires `auto_merge: true` in config) |

## Transition Rules

A work item advances through the pipeline via
`manifest.advance(item_id)`.
The transition logic follows these rules:

1. **Within a stage**: move to the next step in the list.
   Reset `attempts` to 0.
2. **Across stages**: when the last step of a stage
   completes, move to the first step of the next stage.
   Reset `attempts` to 0.
3. **Pipeline complete**: when the last step of the last
   stage (ship/merge) completes, set `item.status` to
   `"completed"`.
4. **No backward movement**: the pipeline only moves
   forward. If a step needs rework, it retries in place
   up to `max_attempts`.

## Step Skipping

Certain steps can be skipped based on configuration or
context:

- **brainstorm**: skipped when `config.pipeline
  .skip_brainstorm_for_issues` is `true` and the source is
  a GitHub issue (the issue body serves as the brainstorm
  output).
- **prioritize**: skipped when there is only one work item.
- **merge**: skipped when `config.pipeline.auto_merge` is
  `false`. The PR remains open for human review.

When a step is skipped, `advance()` is called immediately
without invoking any skill.

## Idempotency Guarantees

Every step must be safe to retry without side effects.
The pipeline enforces idempotency through these mechanisms:

1. **State on disk**: the manifest is saved after every
   transition. If the process crashes mid-step, the same
   step will be retried on relaunch.
2. **Branch isolation**: each work item operates on its own
   git branch (`egregore/wrk-NNN-slug`). Partial work from
   a failed attempt remains on the branch and is visible
   to the retry.
3. **Attempt counter**: `item.attempts` tracks how many
   times the current step has been tried. Skills can read
   this value to adjust behavior on retries (e.g., using a
   simpler approach on attempt 2).
4. **No destructive resets**: retrying a step never reverts
   work from previous steps. The retry operates on whatever
   state the branch is in.
5. **PR deduplication**: the prepare-pr step checks for an
   existing open PR on the work item branch before creating
   a new one. If a PR exists, it updates the existing PR
   instead.

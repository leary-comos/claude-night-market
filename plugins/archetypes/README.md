## Paradigm Evolution Path

### Typical Architecture Evolution Journey
Startups often begin with a Layered Architecture. As the team grows to 10-50 engineers, a Modular Monolith helps manage complexity. Scaling to 50-200 engineers typically necessitates a move to Microservices or a Service-Based architecture. At maturity (200+ engineers), systems often evolve into Event-Driven architectures combined with specialized patterns.

### Common Migration Paths
Migration from a monolith to a distributed system generally moves from Layered to Modular Monolith, then to Microservices, and finally to Event-Driven. Increasing complexity drives evolution from Layered to Hexagonal, then Functional Core, and potentially CQRS/ES. Cloud-native transitions typically progress from Layered to Modular Monolith, then to Serverless or Event-Driven architectures.

### Architecture Decision Triggers

**Scale Triggers** (When to evolve architecture):
- Team size crosses threshold (5, 15, 50, 200 engineers).
- Deployment frequency needs increase.
- Independent scaling requirements emerge.
- Geographic distribution becomes necessary.

**Complexity Triggers** (When to adopt patterns):
- Business rules become complex (Functional Core).
- Integration points increase (Hexagonal).
- Real-time requirements emerge (Event-Driven).
- Audit/compliance needs arise (CQRS/ES).

**Technology Triggers** (When to change patterns):
- Framework migration needed (Hexagonal).
- Cloud migration planned (Serverless/Microservices).
- Performance bottlenecks appear (Space-Based/Pipeline).
- Platform requirements emerge (Microkernel).

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- Each paradigm skill is an opportunity to add a short
  real-world case study showing the pattern in production
- The Quick Reference Matrix could include a "when to
  avoid" column to help users rule out poor fits faster
- Learning path durations are estimates that would
  benefit from community feedback on actual completion
- Migration path guidance could link to concrete commit
  diffs showing a monolith-to-microservice transition
- Architecture decision triggers could include threshold
  numbers calibrated to open-source team sizes

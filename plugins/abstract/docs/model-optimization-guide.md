# Model Optimization Guide

Recommendations for which Claude models to use for different plugin tasks.

## Model Selection Framework

| Model | Use For | Latency | Cost | Context |
|-------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| **Haiku** | Validation, formatting, lookup, counting | Fast | Low | 200K |
| **Sonnet** | Moderate analysis, code generation, summaries | Medium | Medium | 200K |
| **Opus 4.6** | Deep reasoning, architecture, creative tasks | Slow | High | 1M |

### Opus 4.6 Capabilities (Claude Code 2.1.32+)

Opus 4.6 introduces features that affect model selection strategy:

- **Adaptive Thinking**: `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` lets Claude decide when and how deeply to think
- **Effort Controls**: 4 levels — `low`, `medium`, `high` (default), `max` — trade reasoning depth against speed/cost
- **128K Max Output**: Significantly larger output window for complex generation tasks
- **Server-Side Compaction**: Automatic context summarization on the API side, enabling effectively infinite conversations
- **1M Context Window (Beta)**: Available for workloads requiring massive context

### Effort Controls as an Alternative to Model Escalation

Opus 4.6 defaults to **medium effort** (2.1.68+) for
Max and Team subscribers. Medium effort is the sweet
spot between speed and thoroughness for most tasks.

| Approach | When to Use | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Haiku→Sonnet→Opus** | Cost-sensitive workflows, high-volume automation | Cheapest per-token, but model switching adds complexity |
| **Opus@low→@medium→@high** | Quality-sensitive workflows, complex orchestration | Higher per-token cost, but simpler single-model pipeline |
| **Hybrid** | Mixed workloads | Haiku for deterministic tasks, Opus with effort controls for reasoning tasks |

Change effort via `/model` or type **"ultrathink"** in
your prompt to enable high effort for the next turn.

**Opus 4/4.1 removed (2.1.68+)**: No longer available
on the first-party API. Users with these models pinned
are automatically migrated to Opus 4.6.

**Sonnet 4.5 → 4.6 migration (2.1.69+)**: Sonnet 4.5
users on Pro/Max/Team Premium are automatically migrated
to Sonnet 4.6. Agent `model` frontmatter referencing
Sonnet resolves transparently. The `--model` flags for
`claude-opus-4-0` and `claude-opus-4-1` now correctly
resolve to Opus 4.6 instead of deprecated versions.

The hybrid approach is recommended: use Haiku for Tier 1
deterministic tasks, and Opus 4.6 with adaptive effort
for Tier 2/3 tasks that previously required
sonnet-to-opus escalation.

## Decision Flowchart

```
Is the task deterministic (same input → same output)?
├── YES → Use Haiku
└── NO ↓

Does it require subjective judgment or nuanced reasoning?
├── YES → Use Opus 4.6 (effort: high or max)
└── NO ↓

Is it pattern matching with moderate complexity?
├── YES → Use Sonnet or Opus 4.6 (effort: low/medium)
└── NO → Use Opus 4.6 (default safe choice)
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Agent with Explicit Model

When spawning agents for simple tasks:

```markdown
# In agent definition or when calling Task tool
Use model: haiku for this agent when:
- Task is validation or formatting
- Output is deterministic
- No subjective judgment needed
```

### Pattern 2: Hybrid Workflows

Split complex workflows into phases:

```
Phase 1 (Haiku): Gather data, validate inputs, format outputs
Phase 2 (Opus): Analyze, reason, decide
Phase 3 (Haiku): Format final output, generate reports
```

### Pattern 3: Escalation Path

```
Start with Haiku
├── If confidence < threshold → Escalate to Sonnet
│   └── If still uncertain → Escalate to Opus
└── Otherwise → Complete task
```

## Escalation Governance

Escalation (upgrading from a lower model to a higher one) must be principled, not convenient.

### Core Principle

**Escalation is for tasks that genuinely require deeper reasoning, not for "maybe a smarter model will figure it out."**

### Agent Schema

Agents declare escalation hints in frontmatter:

```yaml
model: haiku
escalation:
  to: sonnet                 # Suggested escalation target
  hints:                     # Advisory triggers (orchestrator may override)
    - security_sensitive     # Touches auth, secrets, permissions
    - ambiguous_input        # Multiple valid interpretations
    - novel_pattern          # No existing patterns apply
    - high_stakes            # Error would be costly
    - reasoning_required     # Needs judgment, not just pattern matching
```

### Escalation Hints Reference

| Hint | Description | Typical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `security_sensitive` | Task touches auth, secrets, permissions | Validation finding sensitive patterns |
| `ambiguous_input` | Multiple valid interpretations exist | Unclear requirements or specs |
| `novel_pattern` | No existing patterns apply | First-of-kind implementation |
| `high_stakes` | Error would be costly to fix | Production, breaking changes |
| `reasoning_required` | Needs judgment beyond pattern matching | Trade-off decisions |

### Orchestrator Authority

Hints are **advisory rules** - they should typically be followed, but the orchestrator can override based on broader context:

| Scenario | Orchestrator Action |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hint fires, context confirms complexity | Follow hint, escalate |
| Hint fires, task is actually simple | Override, stay at current model |
| No hint fires, orchestrator senses complexity | Override, escalate anyway |
| Hint suggests sonnet, opus is needed | Override target, go to opus |

### When NOT to Escalate

Escalation is never appropriate for:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Action |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| "Maybe smarter model will figure it out" | Thrashing, not reasoning | Investigate systematically |
| Multiple failed attempts | Wrong approach, not capability gap | Question your assumptions |
| Time pressure | Urgency ≠ complexity | Systematic is faster |
| "Just to be safe" | False safety, wastes resources | Assess actual complexity |

### Investigation Before Escalation

Before escalating, the agent/orchestrator must verify:

1. **Understanding**: Can articulate why current model is insufficient
2. **Investigation**: Systematic analysis was attempted
3. **Capability Gap**: Issue is reasoning depth, not knowledge or approach
4. **Proportionality**: Benefit justifies cost (latency, tokens, money)

See `skills/escalation-governance/SKILL.md` for the complete framework and pressure tests.

## Expected Impact

### Cost Reduction
- Tier 1 tasks (20+ components): ~70-80% cost reduction per invocation
- Tier 2 tasks (20+ components): ~40-50% cost reduction per invocation

### Latency Improvement
- Haiku: 2-5x faster response times
- Sonnet: 1.5-2x faster than Opus

### Quality Considerations
- Tier 1: No quality loss (deterministic tasks)
- Tier 2: Minimal quality impact with proper scoping
- Tier 3: Would significantly degrade quality - keep on Opus

## Monitoring Recommendations

Track these metrics after optimization:
1. Task success rate by model
2. Escalation frequency (Haiku → Opus)
3. User satisfaction with outputs
4. Cost per task category

## Context Management for Subagents

### Server-Side Compaction (Opus 4.6 / Claude Code 2.1.32+)

Opus 4.6 introduces **server-side context compaction** — the API automatically summarizes earlier conversation parts when context approaches the window limit. This is separate from Claude Code's client-side auto-compaction and provides an additional safety net for long-running workflows.

### Auto-Compaction (Claude Code 2.1.1+)

Subagent conversations automatically compact when context approaches the window limit. This is a system-level feature requiring no configuration. With 1M context (Opus GA), compaction triggers at ~800k tokens.

**Log signature**:
```json
{
  "isSidechain": true,
  "type": "system",
  "subtype": "compact_boundary",
  "compactMetadata": { "trigger": "auto", "preTokens": 167189 }
}
```

### Design Implications

| Consideration | Guidance |
|--------------|----------|
| **Long-running subagents** | Safe - won't crash at context limits |
| **State preservation** | Write critical state to files, not just conversation |
| **Progress tracking** | Use TodoWrite or explicit checkpoints |
| **Context reliance** | Avoid depending on early conversation context for late decisions |

### Context Thresholds

| Usage | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| < 80% (~128k) | Normal operation |
| 80-90% | Warning zone |
| > 90% | Compaction imminent |
| ~160k | Auto-compaction triggers |

See `conserve:context-optimization/modules/subagent-coordination` for detailed patterns.

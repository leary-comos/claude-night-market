# Migration Guide: Tools to Scripts

This document describes the migration from distributed tools to centralized utility scripts.

## Overview

The tools have been moved from individual skill directories to a centralized `scripts/` directory to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

## Migrated Tools

### From `skills/modular-skills/tools/`
- `module_validator` → `scripts/skill_analyzer.py`
- `skill-analyzer` → `scripts/skill_analyzer.py`
- `token-estimator` → `scripts/token_estimator.py`

### From `skills/skills-eval/tools/`
- `compliance-checker` → `scripts/abstract_validator.py`
- `improvement-suggester` → Integrated into `abstract.skills_eval` module
- `skills-auditor` → Integrated into `abstract.skills_eval` module

## Usage Changes

### Before
```bash
# Run tool from skill directory
cd skills/modular-skills
./tools/module_validator my-skill

# Or from repo root
./skills/modular-skills/tools/module_validator my-skill
```

### After
```bash
# Run from repo root
python scripts/skill_analyzer.py --validate my-skill

# Or use the CLI command
abstract-skills validate my-skill
```

## Updated Configuration

### pyproject.toml
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
no_implicit_optional = true
explicit_package_bases = true
mypy_path = ["src"]  # Added for proper module resolution
exclude = ['^\.venv', '^\.uv-cache', '^fix_.*\.py$']
```

### Pre-commit hooks
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: v1.11.0
  hooks:
    - id: mypy
      args: [src/]
      additional_dependencies:
        - types-PyYAML
      exclude: ^\.venv/|^\.uv-cache/|^fix_.*\.py$
```

## Benefits

Centralizing utilities into a single directory makes them easier to maintain and reduces duplication by sharing common functionality across scripts. This organization also supports better testing practices and allows all utilities to be integrated into the `abstract-skills` command. Furthermore, the updated configuration improves type safety across the package by enforcing stricter type checking rules.

## Breaking Changes

- Tool paths have changed - update any scripts or documentation that reference the old paths
- Some command-line arguments may have changed - check `--help` for updated usage
- Direct execution of tools from skill directories is no longer supported

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Update any scripts that reference old tool paths
- [ ] Update documentation to use new tool locations
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines that use the tools
- [ ] Install pre-commit hooks for mypy checking
- [ ] Run tests to verify migration is complete

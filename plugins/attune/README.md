# Attune

Project development plugin for Claude Code. Support ideation, specification, architectural planning, project initialization, and implementation.

## Overview

Standardize project development:

1. **Brainstorm**: Ideate and explore problem space.
2. **War Room**: Multi-expert deliberation to select approach.
3. **Specify**: Create detailed specifications.
4. **Plan**: Design architecture and break down tasks.
5. **Init**: Initialize or update project structure.
6. **Execute**: Implement systematically with tracking.

## Features

### Supported Languages

- **Python**: uv, pytest, ruff, mypy.
- **Rust**: cargo, clippy, rustfmt.
- **TypeScript/React**: npm/pnpm/yarn, vite, jest, eslint.

### Configuration

- Git initialization with .gitignore.
- GitHub Actions workflows (test, lint, typecheck).
- Pre-commit hooks and Makefiles.
- Dependency management and project structure.

## Discoverability (v1.4.0)

All attune skills, commands, and agents now feature **enhanced automatic discovery** through optimized descriptions following a proven pattern:

```
[WHAT it does]. Use when: [triggers]. Do not use when: [boundaries].
```

### How It Works

Claude automatically matches your natural language requests to the appropriate attune component based on the description. Enhanced descriptions include:

1. **WHAT**: Clear action or capability statement
2. **WHEN**: Trigger keywords and scenarios (e.g., "starting projects", "comparing approaches")
3. **WHEN NOT**: Explicit boundaries preventing false positives (e.g., "requirements already exist")

### Discovery Examples

| You say... | Claude invokes... | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| "I want to start a new web app" | `/attune:brainstorm` | Matches "starting projects" trigger |
| "Create a specification from my brief" | `/attune:specify` | Matches "create specifications" |
| "Design the system architecture" | `project-architect` agent | Matches "designing system architecture" |
| "Should I convene a war room?" | `Skill(attune:war-room)` | Matches "strategic decisions" |

### Content Structure

Every skill and command includes:

- **When To Use**: 5-7 specific scenarios triggering this component
- **When NOT To Use**: Clear boundaries with alternatives (e.g., "use `/attune:blueprint` instead")

This prevents misuse and guides you to the right tool for your current workflow stage.

## Quick Start

### Architecture-Aware Initialization

```bash
# Interactive mode with architecture selection
/attune:arch-init --name my-project
```

### Standard Initialization

```bash
# Interactive mode
/attune:project-init

# Language specification
/attune:project-init --lang python --name my-project --author "Your Name"
```

### Upgrade Existing Project

```bash
# Add missing configurations
/attune:upgrade-project

# Validate project structure
/attune:validate
```

## Commands

### Full-Cycle Workflow

| Command | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/attune:brainstorm` | Brainstorm project ideas using Socratic questioning | 1. Ideation |
| `/attune:war-room` | **Multi-LLM expert deliberation for approach selection** | 2. Deliberation |
| `/attune:arch-init` | **Architecture-aware initialization with research** | 3. Architecture |
| `/attune:specify` | Create detailed specifications from war-room decision | 4. Specification |
| `/attune:blueprint` | Plan architecture and break down into tasks | 5. Planning |
| `/attune:project-init` | Initialize or update project structure with tooling | 6. Initialization |
| `/attune:execute` | Execute implementation tasks systematically | 7. Implementation |

**War Room Integration**: The war-room is a **mandatory phase** after brainstorming. It automatically routes to the appropriate deliberation intensity based on Reversibility Score (RS):
- **Express** (RS ≤ 0.40): Quick decision by Chief Strategist (<2 min)
- **Lightweight** (RS 0.41-0.60): 3-expert panel (5-10 min)
- **Full Council** (RS 0.61-0.80): 7-expert deliberation (15-30 min)
- **Delphi** (RS > 0.80): Iterative consensus for critical decisions (30-60 min)

The `war-room-checkpoint` skill can also trigger additional deliberation during planning or execution when high-stakes decisions arise.

### Project Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/attune:upgrade-project` | Add or update configurations in existing project |
| `/attune:validate` | Validate project structure against best practices |

## Stewardship

Ways to leave this plugin better than you found it:

- War room deliberation templates are an opportunity to
  add real decision examples showing how RS scoring
  guided an actual project choice
- The mission orchestrator state recovery could document
  edge cases where `.attune/mission-state.json` becomes
  stale or corrupted
- Brainstorming question patterns would benefit from
  domain-specific variants for different project types
- Phase transition checkpoints could include timing data
  from past missions to set contributor expectations

See [STEWARDSHIP.md](../../STEWARDSHIP.md) for the full
stewardship principles guiding this project.
